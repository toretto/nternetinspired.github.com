#What the funk?

Hello. This is the source code for this website: http://nternetinspired.github.com/

It was smashed together hastily by [Seth Warburton](http://twitter.com/nternetinspired).

##That's nice

I built it to allow others to get started quickly with a fast, minimal blog powered by http://jekyllrb.com/ , because I love Jekyll and I want you too.

You don't need to install anything, but for lack of a better word let's call it and install process. It goes like this:
<ol>
    <li>If you don't have one, get a <a href="https://github.com/">Github</a> account.</li>
    <li>Fork this repository: <a href="https://github.com/nternetinspired/nternetinspired.github.com/">https://github.com/nternetinspired/nternetinspired.github.com</a></li>
    <li>Click the 'settings' button and rename the repository to <strong>your-github-username</strong>.github.com</li>
    <li>Wait a couple of minutes, then visit your-github-username.github.com in your browser. Presto.
</ol>

Then to post stuff, you just write a post in Markdown, push it to the _posts folder in your repo. That's it. Really.

There's some additional info in the form of posts (That way you can learn the format too!). So, either just mosey over to the _posts folder of this repository, or visit the website: http://nternetinspired.github.com/
