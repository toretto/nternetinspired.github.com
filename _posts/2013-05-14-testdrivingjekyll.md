Originally, I had written a long (?) post about how I started using Jekyll today. But Safari decided to freak out and sign me out of Github, so that post is a goner. Here's the short version instead.

After a tip from @nternetinspired I've started using Jekyll in combination with Github (yay, free hosting!). The fact that there's hardly any features was a selling point. What really dragged me in is how posts are written: you create files in markdown (a simple markup language) after which you save the files to a specific folder.

For me, this is interesting as it looks like it could improve on my writing experience. No options, modules and buttons to get in the way of the most important part of writing a post - the actual writing!

I'll let you know how that works out. Until then, hold on to your horses.

Toretto Out.
